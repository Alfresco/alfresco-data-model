## This project has now been Archived

The alfresco-core, alfresco-data-model, alfresco-repository and alfresco-remote-api projects have been archived with their code incorporated into [alfresco-community-repo]( https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-community-repo) to simply ongoing development. The same artifacts are still produced by the new project. It also has a branch used as the basis of each of ACS 6 Enterprise release. For more information, set the new projectâ€™s README.md file.

### Alfresco Data Model
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Alfresco/alfresco-data-model.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Alfresco/alfresco-data-model)

Data model is a library packaged as a jar file which is part of [Alfresco Content Services Repository](https://community.alfresco.com/docs/DOC-6385-project-overview-repository).
The library contains the following:
* Dictionary, Repository and Search Services interfaces
* Models for data types and Dictionary implementation
* Parsers

Please note that the data model uses version 2 of the Jackson libraries. 
The upgrade from version 1 was not backward compatible, any projects
that are dependent on data model using Jackson 1.x should use the data-model 6.N branch. 

Version 8.0 of data-model depends on alfresco-core 7.0 which is based on Spring 5.
